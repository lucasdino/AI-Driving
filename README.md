Built a simple python game to achieve the following objectives:
1. Reacquaint myself with python and engage in programming larger projects. Although the code is not polished (I did some refactoring), I would approach this project differently with my current knowledge. ðŸ˜„
2. Utilize a test environment to learn reinforcement learning.

I documented this project on my [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Q-Learning-214e45ce19704294bd365308a77c68b4), where I highlighted the results and key takeaways.
